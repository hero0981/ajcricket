          <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">2024 Pakistan Super League (also known as PSL 9 or, for sponsorship reasons, HBL PSL 2024) will be the ninth season of the Pakistan Super League, a franchise Twenty20 cricket league which was established by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in 2015. It will be contested among six teams in February and March 2024 The Pakistan Super League (PSL) (also known as the HBL PSL for sponsorship reasons) is a men's Twenty20 cricket league contested by six city-based franchise teams. The league was founded in 2015 by the Pakistan Cricket Board. Instead of operating as an association of independently owned teams, the league is a single entity in which each franchise is owned and controlled by investors.

Each team plays the group stage matches in a double round robin format and the top four teams with the most points qualify for the playoffs, culminating in the final.

There have been eight seasons of the league. Islamabad United and Lahore Qalandars being the only teams to have won the title twice, are the most successful teams. The current champions Lahore Qalandars are the only team to successfully defend its title, after winning in the 2023 season.
